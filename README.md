OMG, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Kesari Chapter 2: The Untold Story of Jallianwala Bagh, and wow, my mind’s all over the place! So intense, dude. It’s like they poured every drop of drama and action they could find into it. Those scenes, though! Unreal. My nerves are just... I should’ve expected it, I mean it's literally “untold” for a reason, right? Hell of a story.

You know what I mean, every ten minutes, it’s like BAM, another how the heck did that even happen? moment. I reckon maybe I should have 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   for a re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 later, some bits just need a double take. But man, doing it after work was maybe not my brightest idea—can’t sleep now!

Seriously though, those actors deserve a parade or something, all that emotional stuff and those stunts. Like, it's truly a masterclass in being in the moment. And gosh, anyone who doesn’t get a bit riled up 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it must be made of stone, you feel me? The history, the intensity! Makes my day job as a massage therapist seem like life in slo-mo.

> And the visuals!! I mean, they legit transported me back to the 1919 vibe, like, talk about immersive. Beautiful but brutal? Yeah, that mix. I wonder who does all the design work. Talent. Just talent.

Anyway, I gotta catch up with some sleep, but my mind’s buzzing. If you haven’t seen it yet, just do it when you can and let me know your take! And oh, don’t let me forget to tell you about the crazy story I heard from a client today. People are as wild as  s sometimes.

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {console.log(Why am I even typing this here?)}

Think I’m ready to crash now... or at least try closing my eyes knowing there’s still a world outside this crazy epic tale. These kind of moments make you ponder stuff in history you didn’t even know you needed to think about, y'know? Epic nights, buddy, epic nights. Catch ya later.
